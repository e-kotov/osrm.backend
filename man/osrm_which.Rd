\usage{
osrm_which()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with components \code{executable} (full path to
\code{osrm-routed}), \code{directory} (its parent folder), \code{osrm_version} (character
vector of non-empty lines emitted by \code{osrm-routed --version}), and the raw
\code{processx::run} result in \code{logs}.
}
\description{
Resolves the \code{osrm-routed} executable available on the current \code{PATH}
(or the override provided via \code{options(osrm.routed.exec)}). Runs
\code{osrm-routed --version} to verify availability, then prints the directory
containing the executable together with the backend version reported by
\code{osrm-routed} so you know what will be used in the current session.
